# Folder: jar

This directory is used to store **JAR files**, typically downloaded tools such as:

- `autoupgrade.jar`
- Other Oracle utility JARs (if applicable)

Files are downloaded and managed via update scripts.  
Backups of previous versions (e.g. `autoupgrade_<version>.jar`) are also kept here.

⚠️ **Excluded**:  
This folder should not contain:

- Oracle software patches (e.g. `.zip` files from MOS)
- Custom Java programs or builds
- Temporary downloads or unrelated archives

Please keep the folder clean and versioned JAR files organized.
